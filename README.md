## My Process

## Built with

 - Semantic HTML5 markup
 - CSS custom properties
 - Flexbox
 
 ## What I learned

 My use of CSS has improved thanks to front-end mentor projects. I was able to use flexbox, margins,borders and so many other properties to build the project.My knowledge about box-model has significantly improved.
 Using divs as my containers and adding class attribute to it so as to style it with css is one of my remarkable success. 
 ```html
  <div class=".main-page"></div>
  ```
  ```css
    .main-page{
        color: darkblue;
    }
 ```
### Continued development
When it comes to display flex, i still find some concepts in it confusing. I wish that in subsequent projects i get to use it more often so as to help me become better with my css.

### Useful resources
Most of my resources are videos. Which i would like to recommend to anyone reading this.

**First** is Dave gray videos. It is an 11 hour video, it breaks down the whole concept of css to a beginner.

**Next** : CSS from Zero to Hero video. This is also a tutorial video that will help you create a basichtml and css page.
